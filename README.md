# Dave's StarkNet and Cairo self-study resources

## Introduction

This repository is a curated collection of resources that I have found to be useful in my quest to understand the [StarkNet](https://starknet.io) ecosystem and its tech stack. The resources I have collected here are focused on developers who are looking to understand the StarkNet ecosystem and to get started writing smart contracts with Cairo.

This collection broken down into sections to, hopefully, make it easier to find the resources you're looking for. It is up-to-date as of 23 January 2023. Please let me know if there are any dead links or missing resources. I'm happy to take suggestions for resources to add to the collection. For now, enjoy! I hope this is helpful to you.
