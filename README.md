# Dave's StarkNet and Cairo self-study resources

## Introduction

This repository is a curated collection of resources that I have found to be useful in my quest to understand the [StarkNet](https://starknet.io) ecosystem and its tech stack. The resources I have collected here are focused on developers who are looking to understand the StarkNet ecosystem and to get started writing smart contracts with Cairo.

This collection broken down into sections to, hopefully, make it easier to find the resources you're looking for. It is up-to-date as of 23 January 2023. Please let me know if there are any dead links or missing resources. I'm happy to take suggestions for resources to add to the collection. For now, enjoy! I hope this is helpful to you.

### What is StarkNet?

From the StarkNet documentation itself: "StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation – without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to StarkNet’s reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system – STARK."

Smart contracts for StarkNet are written in Cairo, a smart contract language developed by StarkWare specifically for writing provable programs.

### Setting up the environment

Before you start writing Cairo contracts for StarkNet you're going to need to get an environment set up. Following StarkWare's official docs will get you a basic, but functional environment set up and ready to go.
